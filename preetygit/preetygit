Files that you add to a repository via a browser are limited to 25 MB per file. You can add larger files, up to 100 MB each, via the command line. For more information, see "Adding a file to a repository using the command line."

Tips:

You can upload multiple files to GitHub at the same time.
If a repository has any protected branches, you can't edit or upload files in the protected branch using GitHub. For more information, see "About protected branches."
You can use GitHub Desktop to move your changes to a new branch and commit them. For more information, see "Committing and reviewing changes to your project."
